# Mercari-Price-Suggestion

Overview: 
 
Mercari is a Japanese community-powered shopping app where people can sell their stuff they don’t use but still has value. A typical listing on the website has product name, brand, category, shipping, condition, product description, and price. Sellers are allowed to choose any price for their product. This gives rise to the problem of setting the right price for a product. If the price is too high the product won’t find a buyer or if it’s too low then the seller will be getting less profit. So, if we can suggest a price for the given product listing, it helps the seller to set a better price for the product.  
 
For example, given sweater A and sweater B can we predict the price of the sweaters? 
 
The price of a product may depend on many factors like, brand name, demand and supply, type of product and even picture of the product. For example, electronic products of the same category and brand may have different pricing based on small changes in specifications. The task at hand is to build a machine learning model that automatically predicts the price of a product when given a product name, category, brand, shipping, product conditions, and product description.
